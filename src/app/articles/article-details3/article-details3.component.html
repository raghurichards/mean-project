              With an average global salary of $39k, PHP is one of the most
              popular programming languages in the developer community. It’s the
              language behind the most popular CMS, WordPress. It is in-use by
              79% of total websites globally, including the most used social
              network- Facebook, the largest digital encyclopedia – Wikipedia,
              China’s news giant Xinhuanet, and Russia’s social network VK.com.

              It would be unfair not to credit the rising number of PHP web
              development frameworks in popularising PHP. Today, we’ve some
              really good web development frameworks in PHP like Laravel,
              CodeIgniter, CakePHP, etc. These development frameworks provide a
              set of libraries & API functions to accelerate the web application
              development process securely.

            <h1>9 best PHP frameworks for website development in 2022</h1>
            <p>
              Laravel is one of the most popular PHP frameworks for web
              development with 64k+ stars on GitHub. Though it ranks 7 on PHP
              Benchmarks list of top-performing web development PHP frameworks,
              it tops our list given its huge community, rich feature set, and
              ease of use.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Open source, huge community, Extensive documentation, Zero
                overheads for CFOs, LTS
              </li>
              <li>
                Laravel is an open-source web development framework. Of-course,
                free. It enjoys awe-inspiring support from the PHP developer
                community. And as a result, Laravel wheels are always in motion.
                Right from its launch in 2011 to the time of writing this
                insight, there have been 20 mega releases, Laravel 8 being the
                latest stable version. The Laravel web framework community
                provides LTS versions too. Laravel 6.0 LTS is currently under
                support. Versions before it are no longer maintained.

            <h1>CodeIgniter</h1>
            <p>
              CodeIgniter is a rapid web application development framework with
              a ridiculously small size. CodeIgniter 4, the latest version of
              CodeIgniter, is a mere 1.2 MB in size. Like Laravel, it’s
              open-source and boasts 18k+ stars on GitHub. Just because of how
              bare-bone it is, we have included it in the second position. Like
              several other frameworks, CodeIgniter provides a set of libraries
              and an intuitive interface to accelerate PHP web app development.
              Currently, this is not tracked by PHPbenchmarks.com but is
              considered among the best PHP frameworks for website development.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Apart from the navigation links, it is better to keep all the
                secondary tasks inside the menu (only if they are required) and
                display just the primary ones onto the main page. For example,
                on an eCommerce website, we can put the “My Account” tab under
                the menu rather than on the main page because the users do not
                edit their profile every day (actually not for months).
              </li>
              <li>
                Quite often I have seen that the developers implement horizontal
                scrolling on their website just to make the website look
                different, feel different or because it is a requirement for the
                component. As a user, I can assure you that mobile experience is
                well appreciated if the elements scroll vertically rather
                horizontally. It is only recommended if it is of extreme
                significance and vertical scrolling would make it lose its
                significance. But in a choice between the horizontal scroll and
                vertical scroll, always go with the vertical scrolling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some of the components on your website are best seen on the
                landscape rotation, for example, images. While seeing these
                components, the user almost never rotates his phone to the other
                side on his own. This hurts the overall reputation of the mobile
                website since it has the potential to provide a better
                experience for the user but is relying on the user’s sense. As a
                better option, the developer can provide a prompt on such
                elements to suggest the user switch his mobile’s rotation for a
                better experience.
