              We live in an era of smartphones, and we spend a lot of our time
              on these devices. Do you know an average smartphone user currently
              spends 4 hours and 30 minutes per day on their device? The chances
              are high that you are reading this article on your smartphone too.
            </p>
            <p>
              These smartphones come in all shapes and screen sizes. And your
              prospects and customers can use any of them to access your
              website. This means your website must look good and be easy to
              use, no matter what device people view it on. And that’s where
              responsive design testing comes into the picture. It ensures that
              your website looks good and works well across devices, no matter
              whether it is a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
            </p>
            <h1>What Is Responsive Web Design?</h1>
            <p>
              Responsive web design automatically adjusts the website onto
              different screen sizes, resolutions, and orientation, etc. So if I
              am on a 7.1-inch device, the elements should scale up
              automatically from what they would be on a 5.5-inch device. Today,
              this practice has become more critical than ever as more and more
              people are viewing your websites on different screens and devices.
            </p>

            <h2>For Responsive Design Testing</h2>

            <h3>1. Test For Navigation On Website</h3>

            <p>
              As the device changes, the navigation bar should change with it
              too. A navigation bar is meant for quick navigation to different
              sections or different pages on your website. A navigation bar
              typically contains five or more elements. If we use the @media
              queries with a meta tag and try to scale down the navigation bar
              on the mobile screen, they would neither be visible nor be of
              enough size to be clicked. Thus, we opt for a hamburger menu
              strategy on smaller screens and are very popular. It is so popular
              that a user will intentionally look for it if he cannot find any
              option.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Apart from the navigation links, it is better to keep all the
                secondary tasks inside the menu (only if they are required) and
                display just the primary ones onto the main page. For example,
                on an eCommerce website, we can put the “My Account” tab under
                the menu rather than on the main page because the users do not
                edit their profile every day (actually not for months).
              </li>
              <li>
                Quite often I have seen that the developers implement horizontal
                scrolling on their website just to make the website look
                different, feel different or because it is a requirement for the
                component. As a user, I can assure you that mobile experience is
                well appreciated if the elements scroll vertically rather
                horizontally. It is only recommended if it is of extreme
                significance and vertical scrolling would make it lose its
                significance. But in a choice between the horizontal scroll and
                vertical scroll, always go with the vertical scrolling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some of the components on your website are best seen on the
                landscape rotation, for example, images. While seeing these
                components, the user almost never rotates his phone to the other
                side on his own. This hurts the overall reputation of the mobile
                website since it has the potential to provide a better
                experience for the user but is relying on the user’s sense. As a
                better option, the developer can provide a prompt on such
                elements to suggest the user switch his mobile’s rotation for a
                better experience.
