            <p>
              With the introduction of Angular JS, Google brought a paradigm
              shift in the world of web development. Gone were the days when
              static web pages consumed a lot of resources and resulted in a
              website that is slower to load and with each click on a button,
              resulting in a tiring page reload sequence. Dynamic single page
              websites or one page website became the new trend where with each
              user action, only the content of the page changed, sparing the
              user from experiencing a website full of slower page loads.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the rapid growth of angular and updated ECMA scripts, other
              frameworks like ReactJS, EmberJS, HandlebarJS were introduced that
              had the same objective, developing single page applications. Not
              only in development, but a major revolution was also brought in
              the testing domain. Since single page application requires special
              attention than traditional testing procedures. Letâ€™s take a look
              at the procedures followed while testing a single page angular
              application.

            <h1>Unit Testing Using Karma</h1>
            <p>
              Karma is a testing framework developed by the Angular team. It was
              used not in Angular JS but with version 2 and onwards. When a new
              project is cleared using the CLI, Karma is installed as default
              with the bundle.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Besides working well with Angular, Karma provides you with the
                feature to test your application across various devices like
                tablets or mobiles or even gaming consoles like PlayStation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Karma also helps to integrate testing frameworks like QUnit or
                Mocha with CircleCI, Jenkins and other integration services.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Unit Testing Using Jasmine</h1>
            <p>
              Jasmine is a testing framework based on JavaScript that follows
              Behavior Driven Development or BDD, a common software development
              practice. It is advantageous for testing angular applications
              because
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Describing the test cases in a format that is understandable by
                a human. Instead of using scripts, the language of Jasmine is
                very simple and just by technical reading, you can understand
                what is going on in those test functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Jasmine is free from dependencies and does not need a DOM.
              </li>
              <li>
                It also has a spying feature that allows the tester to track a
                function and check whether a specific attribute was called or
                not.
              </li>
            </ul>
